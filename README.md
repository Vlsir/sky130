# Skywater130 stuff for Vlsir

Half-baked script to generate a Vlsir [Technology](https://github.com/Vlsir/schema-proto/blob/main/tech.proto) message with details about the process.

Depends on Google protobufs and the Vlsir schema but not in a nice way. If you are so motivated you can delete the `vlsir` submodule and `protos` symlink and replace them with a dependency on the pypi vlsirtools package.
